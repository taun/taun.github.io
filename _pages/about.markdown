## Personal Stuff

I've been around for awhile. 

## Business Stuff

I have repeatedly used my broad experience and knowledge in many engineering fields, as well as a strong aptitude in math and user problem solving, plus agile development processes to help businesses to deliver innovative products and services that improved their customersâ€™ lives.

10+ years experience building strong cross-functional agile teams that collaborate to bring integrated hardware & software solutions to market that meet both customer and business needs.

Constantly learning and improving to ensure I can provide better value from my role and my team.
