## [Philly CocoaHeads talk](http://phillycocoa.org/2015/09/)
An overview of the Smalltalk system architecture, and my conjecture as an outside observer, how that architecture has influenced Apple development for the last 35 years. A focus on the technical aspects of Smalltalk with a live demo of a modern Smalltalk system showing how Smalltalk removes many of the pain points programmers experience everyday.
