summary: "Using Cocoa bindings reduces the glue code you once had to write to connect a view to its underlying model."
excerpt: "PhillyCocoaHeads talk - Cocoa Bindings enables you to establish a live connection between an item of data and its presentation in a view. Any change made to the data’s value, either in the view or in the object that stores the data, automatically propagates across the connection. Using Cocoa bindings reduces the glue code you once had to write to connect a view to its underlying model."

It was fun presenting this topic as a [Philadelphia CocoaHeads talk](http://phillycocoa.org/2016/07/11/july-meeting-agenda-5/#more-2205).

## Summary
[Cocoa Bindings](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Devpedia-CocoaApp-MOSX/Bindings.html) enables you to establish a live connection between an item of data and its presentation in a view. Any change made to the data’s value, either in the view or in the object that stores the data, automatically propagates across the connection. Using Cocoa bindings reduces the glue code you once had to write to connect a view to its underlying model.
